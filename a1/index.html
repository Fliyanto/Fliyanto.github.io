          <h3>Question 1</h3>
          <p>
            What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
            the experience?
          </p>

            At first glance, the eye-catching self-moving scribbles draw my
            attention, almost evoking a sense of curiosity about what the
            scribble will turn out to be or will lead towards. This element
            represents a good way to capture the audience’s attention, sparking
            a curiosity that urges further exploration. The smooth transition to
            a distorted title, wrapped around a minimalistic design, really
            creates a centre of focus that the designer wants the users to focus
            on. Interactive texts are also present to create immersion in
            interactive UI design. This immersive experience of interaction is
            further heightened through the help of sound. Soft, elegant, and
            grand sound further enhances the experience, which gives the
            audience an impression of a grand entrance when opening the web
            design.

            My first two minutes were a series of random acts. I started by
            navigating around, trying to see more of what the web design has to
            offer without reading through any of the content. After having a
            brief moment of investigating, I started exploring additional
            content sections. After scrolling through the first couple of pages,
            I was drawn to the embedded videos, where you get to watch a short
            interview, along with further exploration of the model that you can
            freely interact with. I further scrolled and noticed how the
            transitions when presenting an object or a topic are often used as
            an attention grabber, signifying the change of topic, or the start
            of a new section. Not only that the thematic choices of music change
            for each section, giving a clear change to the audience to take as
            feedback or a sign that the topic has shifted.

          <h3>Question 3</h3>
          <p>

            The interactive hotspots that displayed a 3D model of Gehry’s work
            are where I spent the most time. These provided multi-layered
            interaction that was both visually captivating and offered extra
            background information on the creation process. These sections allow
            the users to interact with the model created by Gehry through a 360
            view of a 3D model that you can interact with. The model isn’t just
            something to look at; rather, there are small, subtle buttons that
            you interact with, revealing the journey that was put into the
            design, giving the audience more context. The addition of contrasts
            through implementing early concepts and pictures of the completed
            building highlights the transition from vision to reality.

          <p>
            What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with

            Scrolling through the story was the action I did the most. The story
            was written in concise and simple language, making it easy to follow
            with the help of smooth transitions between sections provided by the
            straightforward interaction. Scrolling was still the main method of
            navigation, but there were some pauses when a particularly
            eye-catching image or hotspot emerged, which required a more
            thorough examination. This way of navigation reminds me of walking
            around an art gallery; the path seems straightforward forward, but
            once in a while, you find yourself lost in an art piece or a section
            that intrigued you the most. Although the navigation is quite
            simple, the addition of elements that are user-friendly, visually
            appealing, and the help of thematic sound lift up the experience.

          <h3>Question 5</h3>
          <p>
            What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
            interactive experience?

            After experiencing the interactive experience first-hand, the
            intended primary goal of this interactive experience is to create a
            thorough yet approachable examination of Gehry’s design process in
            creating the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Not only that they intend to
            inform the audience regarding Gehry’s work, but they also seem to
            want to inspire audiences. This can be explored in how they
            emphasise that vision can be a reality through the addition of a
            contrastive section of early design and final product. The
            experience honours the skill and discipline of architecture by
            showing the Walt Disney Concert Hall as a journey rather than a
            plain, planned building. It aims to show the story behind the
            building, and the wonderful creative ideas that were poured into the
            planning and making.

        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Response</h3>
          <p>
            Through the help of a well-balanced combination of interactive
            elements, clear narrative, structure, and visual design, the primary
            goal is conveyed in an approachable manner. A sophisticated tone is
            created by high-resolution photos and typography, and further
            explorations are encouraged by hotspots, videos, and sections that
            can be expanded. The flexible yet linear navigation strikes a
            balance between user autonomy and guided storytelling, much like a
            physical exhibition. Hover effects and visual contrasts are examples
            of subtle interface cues that draw attention without detracting from
            immersion.

          <p>
            The experience has the possibility of several visits; the experience
            appears to work best for brief to medium sessions lasting around
            five to fifteen minutes. By allowing for partial exploration, the
            segmented structure avoids fatigue and encourages revisits to
            uncover information and details that were overlooked. Concise text,
            layered multimedia, and interactive components allow for rapid
            digestion of information while still encouraging deeper exploration.
            Through repeated engagements, this experience progressively builds
            understanding, drawing the audience more and more into the story
            being told.

          <h3>Question 8</h3>
          <p>
            How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be

          <p>
            Instead of one long sitting, the interactive experience suggests a
            rhythm of slow exploration. Its layout is broken up into easily
            readable, stand-alone sections, each of which hints at more layers
            that are just waiting to be revealed while providing just enough
            details to make the reader feel satisfied. The idea that the
            engagement is not intended to be explored in a single session is
            shown by the use of hotspots, expandable text boxes, and subtle
            prompts that act as invitations to return. Rather, the website
            encourages repeated engagement, allowing users to return and observe
            new information or reconsider previous interactions from a different
            perspective. This method could be a homage to architectural design,
            where seeing an architectural design and trying to understand it on
            one sitting may be too much; rather, it should be taken slowly, and
            as you explore further, the more you can appreciate it. In addition
            to the segmented structure, small ‘rest areas’ can be found around
            the experience, where the user can dive deeper into finding
            information with a much different approach, such as videos,
            interactive models, hotspots and more.

          <p>
            What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?

        <div class="answer">

            The conventions of museum exhibitions, where carefully chosen
            displays are arranged to direct a visitor's attention through a
            planned narrative, are referenced in the experience. Similar to
            items preserved and exhibited in glass cases, Gehry's original
            architectural sketches and archival photos function as digital
            artefacts. At the same time, the addition of audio snippets, videos,
            and narration adds a documentary element, placing the pieces in a
            larger cultural narrative as opposed to being standalone artefacts.
            This reference gives the experience almost a serious tone, placing
            it between exhibition, a documentary and an archive. By using
            elements from these forms, it shows that this experience is more
            than your casual one, rather to show how it has been carefully
            designed a space meant to engage and educate its audience.

            The reference to exhibitions and documentary narratives implies that
            my responsibility as a participant is to approach the experience
            with patience, curiosity, and focus, but more importantly, to enjoy
            what the experience provides. The website encourages visitors to
            take their time, just as they would in a museum, stopping to look
            out for hidden details or consider the bigger picture. The goal is
            to engage with the materials thoughtfully, not quickly or
            efficiently. Expandable features and interactive hotspots encourage
            close attention, guaranteeing that individuals who take the time to
            observe and engage gain a deeper understanding. The website presents
            the user as an active learner who is in charge of their research
            process in this way. The act of scrolling, clicking, and pausing
            becomes less about technical navigation and more about adopting a
            reflective mindset, mirroring the careful observation required in
            both research and architectural appreciation.

        <div class="answer">

          <p>
            The most frustrating element of the interaction lies in its
            occasional lack of clarity and pacing. Without clear guidance, it's
            easy to miss some interactive elements because they're subtle or
            small, especially hotspots embedded in pictures. This may result in
            lost chances for exploration, which seems counterintuitive in a
            design that emphasises exploration. Furthermore, some multimedia
            components take a while to load, which breaks the immersion and
            interferes with the otherwise smooth scrolling experience. The
            experience itself moves a little too slowly at times, especially in
            parts where content revelations are heavily staged. Although the
            purposeful pacing is probably meant to reflect the contemplative
            nature of the subject, users used to quicker digital interactions
            may find it to be drawn out. This tension occasionally made me
            impatient, which prevented the experience from feeling as seamless
            as its design suggested.

            The sense of discovery attained through interaction is the most
            fulfilling aspect of the experience. As if I were unearthing
            artefacts in a carefully curated archive, clicking on hidden
            hotspots to reveal Gehry's sketches, models, or behind-the-scenes
            materials consistently produced satisfying moments. Every new
            finding broadened my comprehension and changed the interaction from
            being a passive observation process to an active learning process.
            The smooth transitions between text, images, and video clips, as
            well as the integration of various media forms, were equally
            satisfying. This resulted in a coherent narrative where no element
            felt disconnected. There was a feeling of completion to this
            skillfully combined interactivity and narrative structure, as though
            every action—whether scrolling, clicking, or pausing—contributed
            significantly to the experience. The harmony between form and
            content ensured that my engagement was both intellectually enriching
            and aesthetically enjoyable, leaving me with a strong sense of
            fulfilment.
